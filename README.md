# Polynomial Regression Project

This project implements polynomial regression to predict salaries based on position levels. It demonstrates the use of both linear and polynomial regression models, visualizing the results for better understanding.

## Files

- **polynomial_regression.py**: Contains the implementation of polynomial regression. It imports necessary libraries, loads the dataset, trains both linear and polynomial regression models, and visualizes the results.
  
- **Position_Salaries.csv**: The dataset used for training the regression models. It contains information about position levels and corresponding salaries.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the `polynomial_regression.py` script:

```
python polynomial_regression.py
```

This will execute the polynomial regression analysis and display the visualizations for both linear and polynomial regression models.
